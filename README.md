# TV Show Listing App

This is a TV Show listing app built with React, TypeScript, and the TVMaze API. The app allows you to search for TV shows, view a list of shows, and get detailed information about each show.

## Features
- **Search TV Shows:** Allows users to search for TV shows by name.
- **List of Shows:** Displays a paginated list of shows fetched from the TVMaze API.
- **Show Details:** View detailed information about each show, such as the show's title, genre, and description.
- **Pagination:** Supports pagination for a seamless experience with a long list of shows.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (with TypeScript), React Router DOM
- **API:** TVMaze API
- **State Management:** React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS (optional styling can be added)

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhagyaj/TV-Show-Listings.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd tv_show_listing
npm install
```

### 3. Run the development server

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the app locally, and it should open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Search for TV Shows:** Enter a show name in the search bar to find matching results.
- **View Show Details:** Click on any show in the list to see detailed information about the show.
- **Pagination:** Navigate through multiple pages of search results with pagination.

## API

This app uses the **TVMaze API** to fetch information about TV shows. For more information about the available endpoints, check the [TVMaze API documentation](https://www.tvmaze.com/api).

## Notes

Here are some recommended improvements and optimizations to make the app production-ready:

1. Error Handling
Add better error handling for network requests, such as displaying user-friendly messages when the API is down or when there are network issues.

Display loading states and error messages in the UI when fetching data from the API.

2. Performance Optimization
Code Splitting: Implement code splitting to load only the necessary JavaScript for each page. This can improve the app's performance, especially as it grows.

Lazy Loading: Use Reactâ€™s React.lazy() and Suspense to load components asynchronously, improving the initial load time.

3. State Management
Consider using a state management library like Redux or Recoil for better state management across components, especially if the app grows in complexity.

Implement global state to manage the search results and show details.

4. Security Improvements
Sanitize User Inputs: If you allow user input (e.g., search queries), ensure you sanitize inputs to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

API Key Management: If the TVMaze API requires an API key, make sure to store sensitive keys securely. For a production app, use environment variables (.env) or a backend service to proxy API requests.

5. Pagination / Infinite Scrolling Enhancements
Implement infinite scrolling (e.g., using the IntersectionObserver API) to improve the user experience when loading large datasets instead of traditional pagination.

Add options to switch between pagination and infinite scrolling.

6. Mobile Responsiveness
Ensure the app is fully responsive and looks good on mobile devices by using CSS media queries or a responsive UI framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI.

7. SEO and Accessibility
Improve SEO by adding meta tags and structured data (e.g., JSON-LD) for better indexing by search engines.

Ensure your app meets WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards for accessibility, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

Use tools like axe-core or React Axe for accessibility testing.

8. Testing
Add unit and integration tests using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure app functionality and reliability.

Implement end-to-end (E2E) testing with tools like Cypress to simulate real user interactions and detect bugs before production.

9. Deployment
Set up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (using GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Travis CI) to automate testing and deployment.

Use a hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify to deploy the app to production with a proper CDN and caching strategy for fast load times.

Optimize images and static assets for faster load times.

10. Analytics and Monitoring
Integrate analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel) to track user interactions and gather data on how the app is used.

Add monitoring and error reporting tools (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) to track runtime errors and user issues.
